# The Enigma machine
<p>This is my fully functioning World War Two-era Enigma machine. Three rotors, one reflector, and six letter pair switches.</p>
<p>To get this working right away, download enigma_cmd.py and access it through the command line. A few taps on the keyboard and you'll have successfully coded your first message in Enigma. To use, download both into the same folder, then access enigma.php through your browser and localhost. An online version is available <a href="https://www.williamfro.st/portfolio/enigma/enigma-machine.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>The file enigma.py is set up to work with enigma.php, which creates a nice user-friendly interface to use the Enigma machine in a browser.</p>
<p>Free to use, although credit is appreciated!</p>
